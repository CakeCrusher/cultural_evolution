      "    \"3_4 has a large amount of resources (67.07 units) and previously donated a very small percentage (0.1%). Based on their previous donations, it appears they may not be inclined to give much back. I have a strategy to build a relationship based on reciprocal giving, so I'll gauge my donation to be small but generous enough to encourage them to reciprocate in future rounds. Given they donated only a small fraction, I might not want to donate too much because they might not return a larger favor if I give a significant amount. Thus, I will give a modest donation that shows a willingness to cooperate, without risking too much of my own resources.\"\n",
